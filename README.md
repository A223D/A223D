# Hi there 👋
### My name is Kushagra Goel, and I'm a Toronto-based developer. I generally work at the intersection of hardware and software, with a little bit of networking thrown in.

### I'm a big proponent of open-source computing ideology, and have contributed to projects like Arduino. Professionally, I'm working at Huawei's Human-Machine Interaction Lab, right here in Toronto.

### 🔭 Currently, I've been working on some very interesting projects that get really inexpensive computer chips to talk to humans using various types of displays like OLEDs, touch-screen LCDs, and even e-paper displays.

Some of my open-source libraries are even available through the Arduino IDE

* [detaBaseArduinoESP32](https://github.com/A223D/detaBaseArduinoESP32) makes working with [Deta.sh](https://deta.sh) Base Instance(an online database) easier by abstracting away the networking and requests part.
* [Adafruit_4_01_ColourEPaper](https://github.com/A223D/Adafruit_4_01_ColourEPaper) is a connector library which helps [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)(one of the leading graphics libraries for low-spec hardware) connect to WaveShare's 4.01 inch colour e-paper display.

### 💡 Here are some ideas that I might work on in the future or might serve as inspiration for you:

* Complete 7-layer OSI Model custom implementation using an ESP32 (maybe light-based physical layer?)
* Infrared-based triangulation using Arduino
* Inexpensive personal assistant system (using an e-paper display attached near a desk)
  * May have command line utility to add/delete to-do list items
  * May send push notifications to phone/computer
* Cloud managed store display tags for products showing videos of products working in live-settings
  * Using LCD displays + ESP32
* Cloud managed hospital room display using e-paper technology
* AdafruitGFX port of SSD1315
  * Similar to SSD1306, but does not work...
* Basic VR using 2 small OLED screens
